# CDK infrastructure as code for chromadb (Fargate on AWS)

Preliminary solution, just a skeleton.

## TODO
- [ ] Authentication
- [ ] SSL-support (API gateway or similar)
- [ ] Persistence (EFS)

Simple stack to run chromadb on AWS in Fargate

## Useful commands

 * `cdk ls`          list all stacks in the app
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk docs`        open CDK documentation

Enjoy!
